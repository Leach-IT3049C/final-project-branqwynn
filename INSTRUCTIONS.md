# Web API

## Insturctions

For this assignment, you will be creating an application that uses one of the following APIs:

* Geolocation
* Notification
* Image Capture
* Media Capture
* File System
* Other APIs [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API)

APIs that don't count for this assignment:

* Fetch
* Storage
* Canvas
* Console
* DOM
* URL
* Anything we've covered before

Application can be anything you want it to be, as long as you incorporate a web API that makes sense.

## Suggestions

These are a few suggestions to help you brain storm:

* Weather application based on current location
* Running/Cycling/Hiking application that tracks where you've been
* Photobooth application
* Video capture application
* Chat application with notifications
* Markdown editor that can load and save markdown files

| 3      | The application works with some defects                                             |
| 1      | There might be the workings of an application, but does not load or work coherently |

| Points | Criteria                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 5      | Identified the Web API being used, what it's capable of, and described any limititations it may present. Use cases are well defined and easy to grade on. Plus criteria below. |
| 3      | Identified the Web API being used and it's use within the context of the application.                                                                                          |
| 1      | Identifying the Web API being used.                                                                                                                                            |

I am not looking for essays on this, just a few sentences that confirm you know what the Web API is, it's capabilities, and limitations if any within the context of your solution.

Keep in mind the use cases you provide are how you are graded on the functional aspect of your application. Failure to properly document these will effect your grade in the two previous sections.
