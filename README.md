## Use Cases (How to test)

* Which Web API did you use, and where is it being used in the application?
I used Geolocation to retrieve location and OpenWeatherApp to find current position/weather. 
* What are application use cases?
The application takes your current location and gives you your current weather status.

## Technical Write-up of selection of Web API selected:
I used the Geolocation and it takes your current location. It's only limited to your longitude and latitude. Then I used the OpenWeatherApp which takes in your current location and gives your state, country, temperature, and weather status. The app as a whole only takes your current location into consideration.

## Self Reflection(s):
I thought this was pretty easy to do and it was pretty fun to make. Overall It took a little bit of time but I could've added more to make it look better.
## How long it took me/us to finish this:
3 Hours
